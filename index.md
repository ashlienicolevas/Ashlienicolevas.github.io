### CPSC 120

* lab 09
    
Lab 09 Part 2 was my favorite activity because I was genuinely interested in discovering the “secret” behind the game and understanding the logic used to determine the hidden number. I enjoyed the challenge of trying to figure out the number myself and seeing how Player 2, who does not initially know the number, must analyze the clues to eventually determine it. In addition, I found it rewarding to see how the code functioned behind the scenes and how each part worked together to create a smooth and interactive experience. Overall, this lab helped me better appreciate both the problem-solving process and the structure of the program itself.


* lab 10
  
    Lab 10 Part 2 was also enjoyable because it focused on population data, which I found interesting to explore. I liked being able to use the program to look up the population of different cities and see how the code retrieved and displayed that information for me. It was satisfying to understand how the data was organized and how the program processed my input to produce an accurate result. Overall, this part of the lab helped me appreciate how coding can be used to analyze real-world information in a clear and efficient way.

  
* lab 11

   It was particularly fun because we were able to do a lot more with the states and their populations. I liked seeing how all the information connected and how the numbers changed from state to state. I also had a lot of fun working with the coding part of the assignment. I felt more confident this time because I understood most of the code and what each section was supposed to do. It was interesting to see how small changes could affect the whole program. Overall, the project was enjoyable, and it made the learning process feel more interactive and engaging.
